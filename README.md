First when i designed the web, i chose my topics for the web would be my favourite artists and Instrument. Then i started to code, i first coded the media queries for different devices. Than i continue with the logo and the navigation link to the home page, the contact page and the feedback page with the same concept that i used in the previous assignment. Than i create a grid layout for the three artists and put those images and songs of these artists in a cards layout and design them to be separate from each other and maintain a good space between each other. Than i create an iframe and put in the favourite songs of my instrument, which is the piano and put those in the flexbox layout. About the box that contain the logo and the navigation link, i put it with the fixed position and for the header of the artists and instrument, i styled them with the fluid typography to improve readability across device.
